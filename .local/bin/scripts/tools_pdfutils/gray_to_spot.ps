%!Convert from DeviceGray to custom spot color
%Here we override two ps functions: setcolorspace and setcolor
%works with ps files made with pdftops (because pdftops generates ps files that use the two functions)
%won't work with ps files made with gs ps2write (because gs generates ps files that use setrgbcolor, setcmykcolor ans setgray)
%bitmap images will be colour inverted. Change /Decode [0 1] to /Decode [1 0] in the source ps file to fix the issue
