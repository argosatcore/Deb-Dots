# Deb-dots
At the core of my computing environment, there are two irreducible components: Debian Buster Stable as a solid foundation to build on, and the Binary Space Partition Window Manager (BSPWM), as one of the most extensible, flexible and, at the same time, minimal frameworks to manage the layout of my computing space.

  The design decisions implemented in these dot files, while at the time of writing this article have taken some distance, were initially based largely on the work of Protesilaos Stavrou. His writings, as well as his videos on free and open source software, remain, in my opinion, an invaluable resource, both technically and philosophically, for those interested in examining an aspect that, for better or worse, has become an inescapable of aspect of contemporary life.
